                        <p><b>Cut the Potatoes |</b> into 1 to 1.5 cm slices. Stack these slices and cut them into the same width sticks to make matchstick fries</p>
                        <p><b>Soak the Potatoes |</b> for at least 20 minutes or up to an hour in order to get rid of excess starch, resulting in fluffier and crispier fries.</p>
                        <p><b>Drain and Dry the Potatoes |</b> arrange them in a single layer to air-dry for a bit. The drier they are before frying, the better</p>
                        <p><b>Fry the Potatoes |</b> bring at least 5 cm of oil in a large heavy pot to 160 C. Once the oil is hot, fry the potatoes for about 5 minutes</p>
                        <p><b>Drain and Cool the Half-Done Fries |</b> drain them on a cooling rack. Let sit until completely cool</p>
                        <p><b>Fry the Potatoes Again |</b> bring the oil up to the 175 C to 190 C range.Add the fries and fry for 5 minutes until golden</p>
                        <p><b>Drain the Fries|</b> drain them on a cooling rack. If you're salting your fries, season them while they are draining and still hot</p>
                        <p><b>Serve and Enjoy</b></p>
