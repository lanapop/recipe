                    <!--BUN-->
                        <p class=title> &#10145 Start with the bun</p>
                        <p>You can find a plethora of burger buns in supermarkets, competing against each other using marketing techniques - claiming the authenticity, softness and an unforgettable taste. Those products are also racing for the highest number of additives and amount of salt and sugar. Scrap that! Your local bakery is your go to place - buy less but better. You will find there freshly baked buns and certainly handmade.</p>
                    <!--MEAT-->
                        <p class=title> &#10145 Moving on to the meat </p>
                        <p> Similar to the bun, local butchers offer greater quality of meat for a very similar price. It is very important to pick meat that is not too low in fat, in which case your burger will risk falling apart when you bite into it. I tend to prefer Angus beef from Ireland, but trust your butcher on this one!
                    </p>
                    <!--CHEESE-->
                        <p class=title> &#10145 The cheese </p>
                        <p>A common mistake is to add too much cheese and as a result kill the taste of the rest of the ingredients especially if you go for a strong cheese such as Roquefort or Fourme dâ€™Ambert.
                    <!--SAUCES-->
                        <p class=title> &#10145 The sauce and the fresh herbs </p>
                        <p> Pick one sauce and one fresh herb. Once again, not too much! You want to taste it all!</p>
                        <p><i>Assemble and enjoy!</i></p>
                </li>
